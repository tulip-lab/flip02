Clicking on the notebook name brings up a dialog which allows you to rename it.  Please renaming your notebook name from \u201cUntitled0\u201d to \u201chello\u201d. This change the file name from **Untitled0.ipynb**  to  **hello.ipynb**.\n\n- **Menu bar** presents different options that can be used to manipulate the way the notebook functions.\n\n- **Toolbar** gives a quick way of performing the most-used operations within the notebook.\n\n- An empty computational cell is  show in a new notebook where you can key in your code.\n\nThe notebook has two  modes of operatiopn:\n\n- **Edit**: In this mode, a single cell comes into focus and you can enter text or execute code.  You activate the **Edit mode** by **clicking on a cell** or **selecting a cell and then pressing Enter key**.\n\n- **Command**: In this mode, you can perform tasks that is related to the whole notebook structure. For example, you can move, copy, cut and paste cells. A series of keyboard shortcuts are also available to enable you to performa  these tasks more effiencient. One easiest way of activating the command mode by  pressing the **Esc** key to exit editing mode. \n\n\n\n\n\n### Get help and interrupting\n\n\nTo get help on the use of different cammands, shortcuts, you can go to the **Help** menu, which provides links to relevant documentation.\n\nIt is also easy to get help on any objects(including functions and methods).

Although we will not use other language in this unit, it is good to know that Jupyter Notebooks  also support JavaScript,  HTML, and Bash commands.\n\n*** Markdown cells***: You have created markdown cell in the previouse section. Markdown Cells are the easiest way to write and format text. It is also give structure to the notebook. Markdown language is used in this type of cell. Follow this link https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/basics  for the basics of the syntax.  \n\nThis is a  Markdown Cells example notebook sourced from : https://ipython.org/ipython-doc/3/notebook/notebook.html\nThis markdown cheat sheet can also be good reference to the main markdowns you might need to use in our pracs http://nestacms.com/docs/creating-content/markdown-cheat-sheet\n\n\n**Raw cells** : Raw cells, unlike all other Jupyter Notebook cells, have no input-output distinction. This means that raw Cells cannot be rendered into anything other than what they already are. They are mainly used to create examples.\n\n\nAs you have seen, you can use the toolbar to choose between different cell types. In addition, shortcut **M** and **Y** can be used to quickly change a cell to Code cell or Markdown cell under Command mode. \n\n\n### Operation modes of IPytho notebook\n\n**Edit mode**\n\n\n\nThe Edit mode is used to enter text in cells and to execute code. As you have seen, after typing some code in the notebook and pressing **CTRL+Enter**, the notebook executes the cell and diplays  output. The other two shortcuts used to run  code in a cell are **Shift +Enter** and **Alt + Enter**. \n\nThese three ways to run the the code in a cells are summarized as follows:\n\n\n- Pressing Shift + Enter: This runs the cell and select the next cell(A new cell is created if at the end of the notebook). This is the most usual way to execute a cell.\n\n- Pressing Ctrl + Enter: This runs the cell and keep the same cell selected. \n\n- Pressing Alt + Enter: This runs the cell and insert a new cell below it. \n\n\n**Command mode**\n\nIn Command mode, you can edit the notebook as a whole, but not type into individual cells.\n\nYou can use keyboard shortcut in this mode to perform the notebook and cell actions effeciently. For example, if you are in command mode and press **c**, you will copy the current cell. \n\n\n\n There are a large amount of shortcuts avaialbe in the command mode. However, you do not have to remember all of them, since most actions in the command mode are available in the menu. \n \n Here is a list of the most useful shortcuts. They are arrganged by the \n  order we recommend you learn so that you can edit the cells effienctly.\n\n\n1. Basic navigation: \n\n   - Enter: switch to Edit mode\n   \n   - Esc: switch to Command mode\n   \n   - Shift+enter: Eexecute a cell\n   \n   - Up, down: Move to the cell above or below\n\n2. Cell types: \n  - y: switch to code cell)\n  - m: switch to markdown cell) \n\n3. Cell creation: \n    - a: insert new sell above\n    - b: insert new cell  below\n\n4. Cell deleting:\n    - press D twice.\n\nNote that one of the most common (and frustrating) mistakes when using the\nnotebook is to type something in the wrong mode. Remember to use **Esc**\nto switch to the Command mode and **Enter** to switch to the Edit mode.\nAlso, remember that **clicking** on a cell automatically places it in the Edit\nmode, so it will be necessary to press **Esc** to go to the Command mode.\n\n### Exercise\nPlease  go ahead and try  these shortcuts.  For example,   try to insert new cell,  modify and delete  an existing cell. You can also switch  cells between code type and markdown type, and practics different kinds of formatting  in a markdown cell. \n \nFor a complete list of shortcut in **Command** mode, go to menu bar **Help->Keyboardshorcut**. Feel free to explore the other shortcuts. \n \n  ",

In *Python 3,  * **/** is float division, and  **//** is integer division; while in Python 2, \n\tboth **/** and **//**\n\tperform *integer division*.  \n\tHowever, if you stick to using **float(3)/2** for *float division*, \n\tand **3/2** for *integer division*, \n\tyou will have no problem in both version. \n    \n2. Instead using function **input()**,  \n\t**raw_input()** is used in Python 2. \n\tBoth functions have the same functionality,\n\ti.e. take what the user typed and passes it back as a string.\n    \n3. Although both versions support **print()** function with same format, \n\tPython 2 also allows  the print statement (e.g. **print \"Hello, World!\"**), \n\twhich is not valid in Python 3. \n\tHowever, if you stick to our examples and using **print()** function with parantheses, \n\tyour programs should works fine in both versions.
