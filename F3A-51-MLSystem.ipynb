Machine learning algorithms are the underlying tools and methods for you to draw such insights. In fact, beyond just being tools, *they provide us a framework to think, generate new ideas and new data products*. As we progress along this course, I hope you will start to build up such intuition.\n\nOne of the most important forms of these \"insights\" is the prediction power from the data. The rest of this tutorial will step you through a typical setting of building such a ML-based prediction model. \n\nOur problem is **face recognition**. Our problem can simply be reduced to two sequential steps:\n1. We are provided with a collection of images, containing **40** different individuals. There are **10**  images for each individual. From this dataset, build a predictive model.\n2. When a **new (unseen)** image is presented to the system, **recognize** the individual in this image.\n\nFace-based identification systems are now being used around the world, most popularly at airports. When applying for a passport, photo of the applicant is taken. We can relate to this as step (1) where the system collects a database of face images to build the prediction model; and the authentication step at the airport is step (2). ",

We then use the training dataset to build the model, and then use the testing dataset, **as if the system has never seen it before**, to test how well the system will perform.\n\nThis line of logics naturally tells us three essential steps to build a machine learning pipeline:\n\n* **Step 1**. **Preparing your dataset in the form that is applicable to apply a machine leaning model** such as logistic regression, decision tree classifier and so forth. This usually also means that one might need to do necessary pre-processing steps (e.g., data cleaning) and then split the data into *training* and *testing* datasets.\n* **Step 2**. **Select a suitable or a set of suitable machine learning models** for your problem at hand and train them using the **training dataset**. This step requires a deep understanding of machine learning models available to you, when it works and it doesn't work, what input is expected, what are its pitfalls, how to interpret its outputs and so on.\n* **Step 3**. **Evaluate the performance of model** using the **testing dataset**.\n\nThis only presents the most essential steps. In practice, we usually repeat these steps several times and have several additional substeps such as: formulating sensible features (**feature extraction**), selecting important features (**feature selection**), selecting optimal model or parameters (**model selection**).",
