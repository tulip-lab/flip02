    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many parameters you can select when building and training a Neural Network in TensorFlow. These are often called Hyper-Parameters. For example, there is a hyper-parameter for how many layers the network should have, and another hyper-parameter for how many nodes per layer, and another hyper-parameter for the activation function to use, etc. The optimization method also has one or more hyper-parameters you can select, such as the learning-rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "One way of searching for good hyper-parameters is by hand-tuning, where you try one set of parameters and see how they perform, and then you try another set of parameters and see if they improve the performance. You try and build an intuition for what works well and guide your parameter-search accordingly. Not only is this extremely time-consuming for a human researcher, but the optimal parameters are often counter-intuitive to humans so you will not find them!\n",
    "\n",
    "Another way of searching for good hyper-parameters is to divide each parameter's valid range into evenly spaced values, and then simply have the computer try all combinations of parameter-values. This is called Grid Search. Although it is run entirely by the computer, it quickly becomes extremely time-consuming because the number of parameter-combinations increases exponentially as you add more hyper-parameters. This problem is known as the Curse of Dimensionality. For example, if you have just 4 hyper-parameters to tune and each of them is allowed 10 possible values, then there is a total of 10^4 parameter-combinations. If you add just one more hyper-parameter then there are 10^5 parameter-combinations, and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "Yet another way of searching for good hyper-parameters is by random search. Instead of systematically trying every single parameter-combination as in Grid Search, we now try a number of parameter-combinations completely at random. This is like searching for \"a needle in a haystack\" and as the number of parameters increases, the probability of finding the optimal parameter-combinations by random sampling decreases to zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial uses a clever method for finding good hyper-parameters known as Bayesian Optimization. You should be familiar with TensorFlow, Keras and Convolutional Neural Networks, see Tutorials #01, #02 and #03-C."

    "## Flowchart\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem with hyper-parameter optimization is that it is extremely costly to assess the performance of a set of parameters. This is because we first have to build the corresponding neural network, then we have to train it, and finally we have to measure its performance on a test-set. In this tutorial we will use the small MNIST problem so this training can be done very quickly, but on more realistic problems the training may take hours, days or even weeks on a very fast computer. So we need an optimization method that can search for hyper-parameters as efficiently as possible, by only evaluating the actual performance when absolutely necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea with Bayesian optimization is to construct another model of the search-space for hyper-parameters. One kind of model is known as a Gaussian Process. This gives us an estimate of how the performance varies with changes to the hyper-parameters. Whenever we evaluate the actual performance for a set of hyper-parameters, we know for a fact what the performance is - except perhaps for some noise. We can then ask the Bayesian optimizer to give us a new suggestion for hyper-parameters in a region of the search-space that we haven't explored yet, or hyper-parameters that the Bayesian optimizer thinks will bring us most improvement. We then repeat this process a number of times until the Bayesian optimizer has built a good model of how the performance varies with different hyper-parameters, so we can choose the best parameters.\n",

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial showed how to optimize the hyper-parameters of a neural network using Bayesian optimization. We used the scikit-optimize (`skopt`) library which is still under development, but it is already an extremely powerful tool. It was able to substantially improve on hand-tuned hyper-parameters in a small number of iterations. This is vastly superior to Grid Search and Random Search of the hyper-parameters, which would require far more computational time, and would most likely find inferior hyper-parameters, especially for more difficult problems."

    "* Try and run 100 or 200 iterations of the optimization instead of just 40 iterations. What happens to the plotted landscapes?\n",
    "* Try some of the other optimization methods from scikit-optimize such as `forest_minimize` instead of `gp_minimize`. How do they perform?\n",
    "* Try using another acquisition function for the optimizer e.g. Probability of Improvement.\n",
    "* Try optimizing more hyper-parameters with the Bayesian optimization. For example, the kernel-size and number of filters in the convolutional-layers, or the batch-size used in training.\n",
    "* Add a hyper-parameter for the number of convolutional layers and implement it in `create_model()`. Note that if you have pooling-layers after the convolution then the images are downsampled, so there is a limit to the number of layers you can have before the images become too small.\n",
    "* Look at the plots. Do you think that some of the hyper-parameters may be irrelevant? Try and remove these parameters and redo the optimization of the remaining hyper-parameters.\n",
    "* Use another and more difficult dataset with image-files.\n",
    "* Train for more epochs. Does it improve the classification accuracy on the validiation- and test-sets? How does it affect the time-usage?\n",
    "* Explain to a friend how the program works."
