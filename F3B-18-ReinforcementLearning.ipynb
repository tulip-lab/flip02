    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial is about so-called Reinforcement Learning in which an agent is learning how to navigate some environment, in this case Atari games from the 1970-80's. The agent does not know anything about the game and must learn how to play it from trial and error. The only information that is available to the agent is the screen output of the game, and whether the previous action resulted in a reward or penalty.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a very difficult problem in Machine Learning / Artificial Intelligence, because the agent must both learn to distinguish features in the game-images, and then connect the occurence of certain features in the game-images with its own actions and a reward or penalty that may be deferred many steps into the future.\n",
    "\n",
    "This problem was first solved by the researchers from Google DeepMind. This tutorial is based on the main ideas from their early research papers (especially [this](https://arxiv.org/abs/1312.5602) and [this](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v518/n7540/full/nature14236.html)), although we make several changes because the original DeepMind algorithm was awkward and over-complicated in some ways. But it turns out that you still need several tricks in order to stabilize the training of the agent, so the implementation in this tutorial is unfortunately also somewhat complicated.\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic idea is to have the agent estimate so-called Q-values whenever it sees an image from the game-environment. The Q-values tell the agent which action is most likely to lead to the highest cumulative reward in the future. The problem is then reduced to finding these Q-values and storing them for later retrieval using a function approximator.\n",
    "\n",
    "This builds on some of the previous tutorials. You should be familiar with TensorFlow and Convolutional Neural Networks from Tutorial #01 and #02. It will also be helpful if you are familiar with one of the builder APIs in Tutorials #03 or #03-B."

    "## The Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial uses the Atari game Breakout, where the player or agent is supposed to hit a ball with a paddle, thus avoiding death while scoring points when the ball smashes pieces of a wall.\n",
    "\n",
    "When a human learns to play a game like this, the first thing to figure out is what part of the game environment you are controlling - in this case the paddle at the bottom. If you move right on the joystick then the paddle moves right and vice versa. The next thing is to figure out what the goal of the game is - in this case to smash as many bricks in the wall as possible so as to maximize the score. Finally you need to learn what to avoid - in this case you must avoid dying by letting the ball pass beside the paddle.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below are shown 3 images from the game that demonstrate what we need our agent to learn. In the image to the left, the ball is going downwards and the agent must learn to move the paddle so as to hit the ball and avoid death. The image in the middle shows the paddle hitting the ball, which eventually leads to the image on the right where the ball smashes some bricks and scores points. The ball then continues downwards and the process repeats."

    "The problem is that there are 10 states between the ball going downwards and the paddle hitting the ball, and there are an additional 18 states before the reward is obtained when the ball hits the wall and smashes some bricks. How can we teach an agent to connect these three situations and generalize to similar situations? The answer is to use so-called Reinforcement Learning with a Neural Network, as shown in this tutorial."

    "One of the simplest ways of doing Reinforcement Learning is called Q-learning. Here we want to estimate so-called Q-values which are also called action-values, because they map a state of the game-environment to a numerical value for each possible action that the agent may take. The Q-values indicate which action is expected to result in the highest future reward, thus telling the agent which action to take.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately we do not know what the Q-values are supposed to be, so we have to estimate them somehow. The Q-values are all initialized to zero and then updated repeatedly as new information is collected from the agent playing the game. When the agent scores a point then the Q-value must be updated with the new information.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are different formulas for updating Q-values, but the simplest is to set the new Q-value to the reward that was observed, plus the maximum Q-value for the following state of the game. This gives the total reward that the agent can expect from the current game-state and onwards. Typically we also multiply the max Q-value for the following state by a so-called discount-factor slightly below 1. This causes more distant rewards to contribute less to the Q-value, thus making the agent favour rewards that are closer in time.\n",
    "\n",
    "The formula for updating the Q-value is:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Q-value for state and action = reward + discount * max Q-value for next state\n",

    "### Simple Example\n",
    "\n",
    "The images below demonstrate how Q-values are updated in a backwards sweep through the game-states that have previously been visited. In this simple example we assume all Q-values have been initialized to zero. The agent gets a reward of 1 point in the right-most image. This reward is then propagated backwards to the previous game-states, so when we see similar game-states in the future, we know that the given actions resulted in that reward.\n",
    "\n",
    "The discounting is an exponentially decreasing function. This example uses a discount-factor of 0.97 so the Q-value for the 3rd image is about $0.885 \\simeq 0.97^4$ because it is 4 states prior to the state that actually received the reward. Similarly for the other states. This example only shows one Q-value per state, but in reality there is one Q-value for each possible action in the state, and the Q-values are updated in a backwards-sweep using the formula above. This is shown in the next section."

A significant part of the research for this tutorial was spent on tuning and stabilizing the training of the Neural Network.\n",

At state $t$ the agent is about to score a point, which happens in the following state $t+1$. Assuming all Q-values were zero prior to this, we should now set the Q-value for state $t+1$ to be 1.0 and it should be 0.97 for state $t$ if the discount-value is 0.97, according to the formula above for updating Q-values."

As a result the Neural Network will also estimate a Q-value near 1.0 for state $t+2$ because the images are so similar. But this is clearly wrong because the Q-values for state $t+2$ should be zero as we do not know anything about future rewards at this point, and that is what the Q-values are supposed to estimate.\n",

For this reason we will use a so-called Replay Memory so we can gather a large number of game-states and shuffle them during training of the Neural Network."

    "\n",
    "Following the 3 convolutional layers there are 4 fully-connected layers each with 1024 units and ReLU-activation. Then there is a single fully-connected layer with linear activation used as the output of the Neural Network.\n",
    "\n",
    "This architecture is different from those typically used in research papers from DeepMind and others. They often have large convolutional filter-sizes of 8x8 and 4x4 with high stride-values. This causes more aggressive down-sampling of the game-state images. They also typically have only a single fully-connected layer with 256 or 512 ReLU units.\n",
    "\n",
    "During the research for this tutorial, it was found that smaller filter-sizes and strides in the convolutional layers, combined with several fully-connected layers having more units, were necessary in order to have sufficiently accurate Q-values. The Neural Network architectures originally used by DeepMind appear to distort the Q-values quite significantly. A reason that their approach still worked, is possibly due to their use of a very large Replay Memory with 1 million states, and that the Neural Network did one mini-batch of training for each step of the game-environment, and some other tricks.\n",
    "\n",
    "The architecture used here is probably excessive but it takes several days of training to test each architecture, so it is left as an exercise for the reader to try and find a smaller Neural Network architecture that still performs well."

    "## Discussion\n",
    "\n",
    "We trained an agent to play old Atari games quite well using Reinforcement Learning. Recent improvements to the training algorithm have improved the performance significantly. But is this true human-like intelligence? The answer is clearly NO!\n",
    "\n",
    "Reinforcement Learning in its current form is a crude numerical algorithm for connecting visual images, actions, rewards and penalties when there is a time-lag between the signals. The learning is based on trial-and-error and cannot do logical reasoning like a human. The agent has no sense of \"self\" while a human has an understanding of what part of the game-environment it is controlling, so a human can reason logically like this: \"(A) I control the paddle, and (B) I must avoid dying which happens when the ball flies past the paddle, so (C) I must move the paddle to hit the ball, and (D) this automatically scores points when the ball smashes bricks in the wall\". A human would first learn these basic logical rules of the game - and then try and refine the eye-hand coordination to play the game better. Reinforcement Learning has no real comprehension of what is going on in the game and merely works on improving the eye-hand coordination until it gets lucky and does the right thing to score more points.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, the training of the Reinforcement Learning algorithm required almost 150 hours of computation which played the game at high speeds. If the game was played at normal real-time speeds then it would have taken more than 1700 hours to train the agent, which is more than 70 days and nights.\n",
    "\n",
    "Logical reasoning would allow for much faster learning than Reinforcement Learning, and it would be able to solve much more complicated problems than simple eye-hand coordination. I am skeptical if someone will be able to create true human-like intelligence from Reinforcement Learning algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "Does that mean Reinforcement Learning is completely worthless? No, it has real-world applications that currently cannot be solved by other methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another point of criticism is the use of Neural Networks. The majority of the research in Reinforcement Learning is actually spent on trying to stabilize the training of the Neural Network using various tricks. This is a waste of research time and strongly indicates that Neural Networks may not be a very good Machine Learning model compared to the human brain."

    "## Exercises & Research Ideas\n",
    "\n",
    "Below are suggestions for exercises and experiments that may help improve your skills with TensorFlow and Reinforcement Learning. Some of these ideas can easily be extended into full research problems that would help the community if you can solve them.\n",
    "\n",
    "You should keep a log of your experiments, describing for each experiment the settings you tried and the results. You should also save the source-code and checkpoints / log-files.\n",
    "\n",
    "It takes so much time to run these experiments, so please share your results with the rest of the community. Even if an experiment failed to produce anything useful, it will be helpful to others so they know not to redo the same experiment.\n",
    "\n",
    "[Thread on GitHub for discussing these experiments](https://github.com/Hvass-Labs/TensorFlow-Tutorials/issues/32)\n",
    "\n",
    "You may want to backup this Notebook and the other files before making any changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "You may find it helpful to add more command-line parameters to `reinforcement_learning.py` so you don't have to edit the source-code for testing other parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Change the epsilon-probability during testing to e.g. 0.001 or 0.05. Which gives the best results? Could you use this value during training? Why/not?\n",
    "* Continue training the agent for the Breakout game using the downloaded checkpoint. Does the agent get better or worse the more you train it? Why? (You should run it in a terminal window as described above.)\n",
    "* Try and change the game-environment to Space Invaders and re-run this Notebook. The checkpoint can be downloaded automatically. It was trained for about 150 hours, which is roughly the same as for Breakout, but note that it has processed far fewer states. The reason is that the hyper-parameters such as the learning-rate were tuned for Breakout. Can you make some kind of adaptive learning-rate that would work better for both Breakout and Space Invaders? What about the other hyper-parameters? What about other games?\n",
    "* Try different architectures for the Neural Network. You will need to restart the training because the checkpoints cannot be reused for other architectures. You will need to train the agent for several days with each new architecture so as to properly assess its performance.\n",
    "* The replay-memory throws away all data after optimization of the Neural Network. Can you make it reuse the data somehow? The ReplayMemory-class has the function `estimate_all_q_values()` which may be helpful.\n",
    "* The reward is limited to -1 and 1 in the function `ReplayMemory.add()` so as to stabilize the training. This means the agent cannot distinguish between small and large rewards. Can you use batch normalization to fix this problem, so you can use the actual reward values?\n",
    "* Can you improve the training by adding L2-regularization or dropout?\n",
    "* Try using other optimizers for the Neural Network. Does it help with the training speed or stability?\n",
    "* Let the agent take up to 30 random actions at the beginning of each new episode. This is used in some research papers to further randomize the game-environment, so the agent cannot memorize the first sequence of actions.\n",
    "* Try and save the game at regular intervals. If the agent dies, then you can reload the last saved game. Would this help training the agent faster and better, because it does not need to play the game from the beginning?\n",
    "* There are some invalid actions available to the agent in OpenAI Gym. Does it improve the training if you only allow the valid actions from the game-environment?\n",
    "* Does the MotionTracer work for other games? Can you improve on the MotionTracer?\n",
    "* Try and use the last 4 image-frames from the game instead of the MotionTracer.\n",
    "* Try larger and smaller sizes for the replay memory.\n",
    "* Try larger and smaller discount rates for updating the Q-values.\n",
    "* If you look closely in the states and actions that are display above, you will note that the agent has sometimes taken actions that do not correspond to the movement of the paddle. For example, the action might be LEFT but the paddle has either not moved at all, or it has moved right instead. Is this a bug in the source-code for this tutorial, or is it a bug in OpenAI Gym, or is it a bug in the underlying Atari Learning Environment? Does it matter?"
