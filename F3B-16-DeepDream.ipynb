Tutorial #13 showed how to use the gradient for generating images that caused specific features  inside the neural network to respond.\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial uses a similar idea as the previous tutorials. But we will now use the gradient of the neural network to amplify patterns in the input image. This is commonly called the DeepDream algorithm, but there are actually many different variations of the technique.\n",

    "This flowchart shows roughly the idea of the DeepDream algorithm. We use the Inception model which has many more layers than shown here. We use TensorFlow to automatically derive the gradient for a given layer in the network with respect to the input image. The gradient is then used to update the input image. This procedure is repeated a number of times until patterns have emerged and we are satisfied with the resulting image.\n",

    "There are some details of the DeepDream algorithm not shown here, e.g. that the gradient is blurred, which has some advantages discussed further below. The gradient is also calculated in tiles so it can work on very high-resolution images without running out of computer memory."

    "One solution is to downscale the input image to 200-300 pixels. But such a low resolution is pixelated and ugly.\n",

    "* Plot the gradients when you run `optimize_image()`. Do you see any artifacts? What do you think is the cause? Does it matter? Can you find a way to remove them?\n",
    "* Try using random noise as the input image. This is similar to Tutorial #13 for visually analyzing the features. Are the generated images better in this tutorial? Why?\n",
    "* Try and remove `tf.square()` inside `Inception5h.get_gradient()` in the file `inception5h.py`. What happens to the DeepDream images? Why is that?\n",
    "* Can you move the gradient outside of `optimize_image()` to save memory?\n",
    "* Can you make the program run faster? An idea would be to implement the gaussian blur and resizing directly in TensorFlow.\n",
    "* Make a DeepDream movie by repeatedly calling `optimize_image()` and zooming a little on the image.\n",
    "* Process a movie frame-by-frame. You may need to use some kind of stabilization across the individual frames.\n",
    "* Explain to a friend how the program works."
