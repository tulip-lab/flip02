    "This tutorial demonstrates how to save and restore the variables of a Neural Network. During optimization we save the variables of the neural network whenever its classification accuracy has improved on the validation-set. The optimization is aborted when there has been no improvement for 1000 iterations. We then reload the variables that performed best on the validation-set.\n",
    "\n",

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial showed how to save and retrieve the variables of a neural network in TensorFlow. This can be used in different ways. For example, if you want to use a neural network for recognizing images then you only have to train the network once and you can then deploy the finished network on other computers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another use of checkpoints is if you have a very large neural network and data-set, then you may want to save checkpoints at regular intervals in case the computer crashes, so you can continue the optimization at a recent checkpoint instead of having to restart the optimization from the beginning.\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial also showed how to use the validation-set for so-called Early Stopping, where the optimization was aborted if it did not regularly improve the validation error. This is useful if the neural network starts to overfit and learn the noise of the training-set; although it was not really an issue with the convolutional network and MNIST data-set used in this tutorial.\n",
    "\n",
    "An interesting observation was that the convolutional weights (or filters) changed very little from the optimization, even though the performance of the network went from random guesses to near-perfect classification. It seems strange that the random weights were almost good enough. Why do you think this happens?"

    "\n",
    "You may want to backup this Notebook before making any changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Optimization is stopped after 1000 iterations without improvement. Is this enough? Can you think of a better way to do Early Stopping? Try and implement it.\n",
    "* If the checkpoint file already exists then load it instead of doing the optimization.\n",
    "* Save a new checkpoint for every 100 optimization iterations. Retrieve the latest using `saver.latest_checkpoint()`. Why would you want to save multiple checkpionts instead of just the most recent?\n",
    "* Try and change the neural network, e.g. by adding another layer. What happens when you reload the variables from a different network?\n",
    "* Plot the weights for the 2nd convolutional layer before and after optimization using the function `plot_conv_weights()`. Are they almost identical as well?\n",
    "* Why do you think the optimized convolutional weights are almost the same as the random initialization?\n",
    "* Remake the program yourself without looking too much at this source-code.\n",
