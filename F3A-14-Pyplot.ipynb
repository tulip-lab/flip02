Each pyplot function makes some change to a figure: e.g., creates a figure, creates a plotting area in a figure, plots some lines in a plotting area, decorates the plot with labels, etc. In `matplotlib.pyplot` various states are preserved across function calls, so that it keeps track of things like the current figure and plotting area, and the plotting functions are directed to the current axes (please note that \u201caxes\u201d here and in most places in the documentation refers to the axes part of a figure and not the strict mathematical term for more than one axis).\n\n\n## Importing the Interface\n\nRather than talk at length about the `pyplot` interface, let's just go ahead and jump right in and start playing around with it.

If you've run into this issue, fear not, IPython provides a function that allows you to specify the output formats that you want to support, and one of those just happens to be the 'retina' format. \n\nTo add support for retina output, you'll have to import a function called `set_matplotlib_formats` from the `IPython.display` module. Then call it and pass in the string `'retina'`.

            "source": "## Understanding the `pyplot` Interface\n\nBefore we go any further, there are a few things that you need to understand about the `pyplot` interface that will make working with matplotlib a lot smoother. First, the `pyplot` interface is a stateful interface, and second, it has two modes: interactive and non-interactive mode. \n\n### A Stateful Interface\n\nNow, what do I mean when I say that `pyplot` provides a \"stateful interface\"? Well, when you create a visualization there are usually several steps you need to work through to get it just right. For example, you'll need to plot the data itself. Then, you may need to adjust the limits of the axes, and possibly change the labels for the tick marks as well.  To make the visualization easier to understand, you may want to add x- and y-axis labels, a title, and maybe even a legend. Doing all of these modifications in one command would be tough enough from a script, but in an interactive interpreter session, like this one, it would be simply too painful to even bother with. Instead, a better way to do this would be to perform each change in a seperate step allowing you to focus on one task at a time. The `pyplot` interface does exactly that through its \"stateful interface\". \n\nIn short, every `pyplot` function you call changes the internal state of the current visualization. So, a call to the `plot()` function, for example, may create several objects in the background, or simply update existing ones that were created by a previous function call. The point is, you don't have to worry about creating instances of classes or modifying them directly, instead you can just focus on the visualization. \n\nLet's give the stateful interface a try now by building up a simple plot. We'll start by plotting a few randomly generated lines, then we'll add a title to our plot to make it a bit easier to understand what it's displaying. We'll do this in two separate steps to show off the stateful nature of the `pyplot` interface.\n\nSo, first things first, let's import the numpy library to give us access to some nice functions for generating random data.

            "source": "The main thing to notice here is that we had four different interactions with the `pyplot` module: 3 calls to the `plot()` function and 1 to the `title()` function, and in each case, the result was that the current visualization was updated with the requested change. The components of that visualization, i.e., the class instances that make up the visualization, are completely invisible to us. Instead, we simply concentrate on the how the visualization should look and ignore everything that goes into making that visualization. This ends up being such an intuitive interface, and it's easy to see why this is the preferred method for interactive data visualization with matplotlib. You essentially lower your cognitive load by concentrating on only one aspect of a visualization at a time and build it up step-by-step.\n\n### Interactive Mode\n\nNow, if you're working from the command line, you may have noticed that the very first call to the `plot` function caused a new figure to pop up in a separate window. The subsequent call to the `title` function actually updated the already existing figure like magic, right in front of your eyes. That's because the call you made earlier to the `ion` function turned on `pyplot's` interactive mode. In interactive mode, every call you make to the `pyplot` module results in a change to the currently displayed figure. Without interactive mode turned on, you would need to call the `pyplot.show` function to display the current figure, but you would lose the ability to interact with that figure once you did. You can give it a try now by first calling the `pyplot.ioff` function to turn off interactive mode.",

However, for those of you following along in a Jupyter notebook, you may have noticed that a histogram plot appeared as soon as you executed the previous cell. Unfortunately, turning off interactive mode in a notebook is not as easy as just calling the `pyplot.ioff` function. The reason is that our earlier call to the `%matplotlib inline` magic function does a little bit of extra setup for us to get interactive mode working properly in a notebook. So, to turn off interactive mode in this case, we'll need to undo that extra setup. Specifically, an event listener was added to the `'post_execute'` event that will flush the current figure every time we execute the code in a cell. To remove the event listener, we'll first need to grab a reference to the current IPython shell (the one we're currently interacting with), and then we'll remove the `flush_figures` function from the `'post_execute'` event listener for the current shell. \n\nSo, let's get started by first getting a reference to the current shell.

Obviously, when working with your data interactively, as we've been doing here, interactive mode is the way to go. However, if you plan on writing a script to process data \"offline\" and create a handful of visualizations with that data, non-interactive mode is the one to choose. In fact, the default mode for matplotlib is non-interactive as is evidenced by the fact that you have to explicitly turn on interactive mode in both the command line interpreter and a Jupyter notebook (remember the call we made to the `%matplotlib inline` magic function did that for us). \n\nSo, in short, when writing a script to create visualizations with matplotlib, leave interactive mode off. However, when interacting directly with your data in a command line, or Jupyter notebook session, having interactive mode on makes the interaction much more pleasant on the whole.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nAnd, with that said, we've come to the end of this session. To recap, in this lesson, we learned about `pyplot`'s stateful interface, and we played around with both the interactive and non-interactive modes a bit and learned when it's appropriate to use each one. Though this lesson is done, we're not done with the `pyplot` interface just yet. Over the next several lessons we'll explore what the `pyplot` interface has to offer by diving into each of the most commonly used plotting functions in the `pyplot` module.  ",
