However, many datasets today are too large to be stored on a single computer, and even when a dataset can be stored on one computer (such as the datasets in this tutorial), the dataset can often be processed much more quickly using multiple computers.  Spark has efficient implementations of a number of transformations and actions that can be composed together to perform data processing and analysis.  Spark excels at distributing these operations across a cluster while abstracting away many of the underlying implementation details. Spark has been designed with a focus on scalability and efficiency. With Spark you can begin developing your solution on your laptop, using a small dataset, and then use that same code to process terabytes or even petabytes across a distributed cluster.\n\nThe following transformations will be covered:\n*  `map()`, `mapPartitions()`, `mapPartitionsWithIndex()`, `filter()`, `flatMap()`, `reduceByKey()`, `groupByKey()`\n \nThe following actions will be covered:\n*  `first()`, `take()`, `takeSample()`, `takeOrdered()`, `collect()`, `count()`, `countByValue()`, `reduce()`, `top()`\n \nAlso covered:\n*  `cache()`, `unpersist()`, `id()`, `setName()`\n \nNote that, for reference, you can look up the details of these methods in [Spark's Python API](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/pyspark.html#pyspark.RDD)\n\nAfter that you will test that the virtual machine (VM) is functioning properly.\n\nYou will not need to solve any problems to complete this lab.  You can run a cell by pressing \"shift-enter\", which will compute the current cell and advance to the next cell, or by clicking in a cell and pressing \"control-enter\", which will compute the current cell and remain in that cell.

Introduction to [pySpark API](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/pyspark.html#pyspark.RDD) running in the browser**\n\n#### **Spark Context**\n\nIn Spark, communication occurs between a driver and executors.  The driver has Spark jobs that it needs to run and these jobs are split into tasks that are submitted to the executors for completion.  The results from these tasks are delivered back to the driver.\n\nIn section 1, we saw that normal python code can be executed via cells. When using Databricks Cloud this code gets executed in the Spark driver's Java Virtual Machine (JVM) and not in an executor's JVM, and when using an IPython notebook it is executed within the kernel associated with the notebook. Since no Spark functionality is actually being used, no tasks are launched on the executors.\n\nIn order to use Spark functionality and its API we will need to use a `SparkContext`.  When running Spark, you start a new Spark application by creating a [SparkContext](http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/pyspark.html#pyspark.SparkContext).  When the `SparkContext` is created, it asks the master for some cores to use to do work.  The master sets these cores aside just for you; they won't be used for other applications. When using Databricks Cloud or the virtual machine provisioned for this class, the `SparkContext` is created for you automatically as `sc`.",

The web UI is accessible in Databricks cloud by going to \"Clusters\" and then clicking on the \"View Spark UI\" link for your cluster.  When running locally you'll find it at [localhost:4040](http://localhost:4040).  In the web UI, under the \"Jobs\" tab, you can see a list of jobs that have been scheduled or run.  It's likely there isn't any thing interesting here yet because we haven't run any jobs, but we'll return to this page later.\n\nAt a high level, every Spark application consists of a driver program that launches various parallel operations on executor Java Virtual Machines (JVMs) running either in a cluster or locally on the same machine. When running a cluster, such as ...In Databricks Cloud, \"Databricks Shell\" is the driver program.  When running locally, \"PySparkShell\" is the driver program. In all cases, this driver program contains the main loop for the program and creates distributed datasets on the cluster, then applies operations (transformations & actions) to those datasets.\n\nDriver programs access Spark through a SparkContext object, which represents a connection to a computing cluster. A Spark context object (`sc`) is the main entry point for Spark functionality. A Spark context can be used to create Resilient Distributed Datasets (RDDs) on a cluster.",

Each partition holds a unique subset of the entries in the list.  Spark calls datasets that it stores \"Resilient Distributed Datasets\" (RDDs).\n\nOne of the defining features of Spark, compared to other data analytics frameworks (e.g., Hadoop), is that it stores data in memory rather than on disk.  This allows Spark applications to run much more quickly, because they are not slowed down by needing to read data from disk.\n\nThe figure below illustrates how Spark breaks a list of data entries into partitions that are each stored in memory on a worker.\n![partitions](http://spark-mooc.github.io/web-assets/images/partitions.png)\n\nTo create the RDD, we use `sc.parallelize()`, which tells Spark to create a new set of input data based on data that is passed in.  In this example, we will provide an `xrange`.  The second argument to the [sc.parallelize()](http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/pyspark.html#pyspark.SparkContext.parallelize) method tells Spark how many partitions to break the data into when it stores the data in memory (we'll talk more about this later in this tutorial). Note that for better performance when using `parallelize`, `xrange()` is recommended if the input represents a range. This is the reason why we used `xrange()` in 3a.\n\nThere are many different types of RDDs.  The base class for RDDs is [pyspark.RDD](http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/pyspark.html#pyspark.RDD) and other RDDs subclass `pyspark.RDD`.  Since the other RDD types inherit from `pyspark.RDD` they have the same APIs and are functionally identical.  We'll see that `sc.parallelize()` generates a `pyspark.rdd.PipelinedRDD` when its input is an `xrange`, and a `pyspark.RDD` when its input is a `range`.\n\nAfter we generate RDDs, we can view them in the \"Storage\" tab of the web UI.  You'll notice that new datasets are not listed until Spark needs to return a result due to an action being executed.  This feature of Spark is called \"lazy evaluation\".

Let's look at what happens when we do a basic operation on the dataset.  Many useful data analysis operations can be specified as \"do something to each item in the dataset\".  These data-parallel operations are convenient because each item in the dataset can be processed individually: the operation on one entry doesn't effect the operations on any of the other entries.  Therefore, Spark can parallelize the operation.\n\n`map(f)`, the most common Spark transformation, is one such example: it applies a function `f` to each item in the dataset, and outputs the resulting dataset.  When you run `map()` on a dataset, a single *stage* of tasks is launched.  A *stage* is a group of tasks that all perform the same computation, but on different input data.  One task is launched for each partitition, as shown in the example below.  A task is a unit of execution that runs on a single machine. When we run `map(f)` within a partition, a new *task* applies `f` to all of the entries in a particular partition, and outputs a new partition. In this example figure, the dataset is broken into four partitions, so four `map()` tasks are launched.\n![tasks](http://spark-mooc.github.io/web-assets/images/tasks.png)\n\nThe figure below shows how this would work on the smaller data set from the earlier figures.  Note that one task is launched for each partition.\n![foo](http://spark-mooc.github.io/web-assets/images/map.png)\n\nWhen applying the `map()` transformation, each item in the parent RDD will map to one element in the new RDD. So, if the parent RDD has twenty elements, the new RDD will also have twenty items.\n\nNow we will use `map()` to subtract one from each value in the base RDD we just created. First, we define a Python function called `sub()` that will subtract one from the input integer. Second, we will pass each item in the base RDD into a `map()` transformation that applies the `sub()` function to each element. And finally, we print out the RDD transformation hierarchy using `toDebugString()`.",

To do this we call the `collect()` method on our RDD.  `collect()` is often used after a filter or other operation to ensure that we are only returning a *small* amount of data to the driver.  This is done because the data returned to the driver must fit into the driver's available memory.  If not, the driver will crash.\n\nThe `collect()` method is the first action operation that we have encountered.  Action operations cause Spark to perform the (lazy) transformation operations that are required to compute the RDD returned by the action.  In our example, this means that tasks will now be launched to perform the `parallelize`, `map`, and `collect` operations.\n\nIn this example, the dataset is broken into four partitions, so four `collect()` tasks are launched. Each task collects the entries in its partition and sends the result to the SparkContext, which creates a list of the values, as shown in the figure below.\n![collect](http://spark-mooc.github.io/web-assets/images/collect.png)\n\nThe above figures showed what would happen if we ran `collect()` on a small example dataset with just four partitions.\n\nNow let's run `collect()` on `subRDD`.",

In Spark, we can do that using the `first()`, `take()`, `top()`, and `takeOrdered()` actions. Note that for the `first()` and `take()` actions, the elements that are returned depend on how the RDD is *partitioned*.\n\nInstead of using the `collect()` action, we can use the `take(n)` action to return the first n elements of the RDD. The `first()` action returns the first element of an RDD, and is equivalent to `take(1)`.\n\nThe `takeOrdered()` action returns the first n elements of the RDD, using either their natural order or a custom comparator. The key advantage of using `takeOrdered()` instead of `first()` or `take()` is that `takeOrdered()` returns a deterministic result, while the other two actions may return differing results, depending on the number of partions or execution environment. `takeOrdered()` returns the list sorted in *ascending order*.  The `top()` action is similar to `takeOrdered()` except that it returns the list in *descending order.*\n\nThe `reduce()` action reduces the elements of a RDD to a single value by applying a function that takes two parameters and returns a single value.  The function should be commutative and associative, as `reduce()` is applied at the partition level and then again to aggregate results from partitions.  If these rules don't hold, the results from `reduce()` will be inconsistent.  Reducing locally at partitions makes `reduce()` very efficient.",

A pair RDD is an RDD where each element is a pair tuple (key, value).  For example, `sc.parallelize([('a', 1), ('a', 2), ('b', 1)])` would create a pair RDD where the keys are 'a', 'a', 'b' and the values are 1, 2, 1.\n\nThe `reduceByKey()` transformation gathers together pairs that have the same key and applies a function to two associated values at a time. `reduceByKey()` operates by applying the function first within each partition on a per-key basis and then across the partitions.\n\nWhile both the `groupByKey()` and `reduceByKey()` transformations can often be used to solve the same problem and will produce the same answer, the `reduceByKey()` transformation works much better for large distributed datasets. This is because Spark knows it can combine output with a common key on each partition *before* shuffling (redistributing) the data across nodes.  Only use `groupByKey()` if the operation would not benefit from reducing the data before the shuffle occurs.\n\nLook at the diagram below to understand how `reduceByKey` works.  Notice how pairs on the same machine with the same key are combined (by using the lamdba function passed into reduceByKey) before the data is shuffled. Then the lamdba function is called again to reduce all the values from each partition to produce one final result.\n![reduceByKey() figure](http://spark-mooc.github.io/web-assets/images/reduce_by.png)\n\nOn the other hand, when using the `groupByKey()` transformation - all the key-value pairs are shuffled around, causing a lot of unnecessary data to being transferred over the network.\n\nTo determine which machine to shuffle a pair to, Spark calls a partitioning function on the key of the pair. Spark spills data to disk when there is more data shuffled onto a single executor machine than can fit in memory. However, it flushes out the data to disk one key at a time, so if a single key has more key-value pairs than can fit in memory an out of memory exception occurs. This will be more gracefully handled in a later release of Spark so that the job can still proceed, but should still be avoided.  When Spark needs to spill to disk, performance is severely impacted.\n![groupByKey() figure](http://spark-mooc.github.io/web-assets/images/group_by.png)\n\nAs your dataset grows, the difference in the amount of data that needs to be shuffled, between the `reduceByKey()` and `groupByKey()` transformations, becomes increasingly exaggerated.\n\nHere are more transformations to prefer over `groupByKey()`:\n  +   [combineByKey()](http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/pyspark.html#pyspark.RDD.combineByKey) can be used when you are combining elements but your return type differs from your input value type.\n  +   [foldByKey()](http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/pyspark.html#pyspark.RDD.foldByKey) merges the values for each key using an associative function and a neutral \"zero value\".\n\nNow let's go through a simple `groupByKey()` and `reduceByKey()` example.",

However, memory is limited, so if you try to keep too many RDDs in memory, Spark will automatically delete RDDs from memory to make space for new RDDs. If you later refer to one of the RDDs, Spark will automatically recreate the RDD for you, but that takes time.\n\nSo, if you plan to use an RDD more than once, then you should tell Spark to cache that RDD. You can use the `cache()` operation to keep the RDD in memory. However, if you cache too many RDDs and Spark runs out of memory, it will delete the least recently used (LRU) RDD first. Again, the RDD will be automatically recreated when accessed.\n\nYou can check if an RDD is cached by using the `is_cached` attribute, and you can see your cached RDD in the \"Storage\" section of the Spark web UI.
