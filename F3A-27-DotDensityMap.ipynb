While choropleths are great for showing data that's associated with a specific geographic area, like a county for instance, when you want to take a more granular look at your data, you may find that a [dot density map][2] is the more appropriate tool for the job. In this lesson, we'll create a one-to-one dot density map of the crime in San Francisco using images from the the [ArcGIS online service][3]. \n\n[1]: http://matplotlib.org/basemap/\n[2]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot_distribution_map\n[3]: http://www.arcgis.com/features/\n\n## What is a Dot Density Map?\n\nWhile the name may sound intimidating, the actual concept is quite simple, in fact, I would wager that nearly all of us already quite familiar with the concept of a dot density map. A dot density map is what many of us would associate with the term heat map. But, while a heat map is a more generic term, a dot density map means something very specific. Like a choropleth, it maps the presence of a specific phenomenon, but where a choropleth associates a value with a specific geographic boundary, like a county or state, a dot density map, plots the actual location of the phenomenon's occurrence. Doing so allows the viewer to quickly see where areas of large observations of the phenomenon occur. \n\nAs an example, let's take a look at one of the most historically important dot density maps: the English physician [John Snow][1]'s map of cholera cases during the [London epidemic of 1854][2]. \n\n<img src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/27/Snow-cholera-map-1.jpg\" alt=\"Cholera Map of 1854\" width=\"800\" />\n\nWe can see in the map above, that the number of cases is largest towards the center of the map. By plotting the actual occurrences themselves, rather than an aggregate for the area (as you would have with a choropleth), it was easy for Dr. Snow to see that the largest concentration of cholera cases occurred around the intersection of Broad St. and Little Windmill St., where a water pump for the town was located. This observation helped Dr. Snow conclude that contaminated water was the culprit in the spread of the illness, and ultimately led to the end of the epidemic. Had a map with a lower granularity, say a choropleth, been used, this discovery may have taken longer to come about, and many lives would have been unnecessarily lost in the interim.\n\nSo, from this historical example, it's easy to see just how useful a dot density map can be. So then, how do we make one ourselves? Well, we start by setting up our notebook and getting the data.\n\n[1]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Snow_(physician)\n[2]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1854_Broad_Street_cholera_outbreak",

We'll be working with crime data, so you'll need to click on the [Public Safety][2] link, and then the link for [SFPD Incidents][3]. If you followed the links correctly, you should end up on a page that looks just like the image below.\n\n![SFPD Incidents](./images/SFPD Incidents.png \"SFPD Incidents\")\n\n[1]: https://data.sfgov.org \n[2]: https://data.sfgov.org/data?category=Public%20Safety\n[3]: https://data.sfgov.org/Public-Safety/SFPD-Incidents-from-1-January-2003/tmnf-yvry\n\nWe're going to take a look at the crime in San Francisco over the past 6 months, so you'll need to select the beginning and end dates in the \"Date is between\" filter (you should notice the data being displayed automatically updates once you've selected your dates). Then, select the \"Export\" button at the top of the page and choose \"JSON\" as the download type. \n\n> The JSON file doesn't actually download to your machine, so you'll probably need to save the file once it's done loading.\n\nOnce, you get the file downloaded, you'll need to place it in a location where your code can find it. The code in this example assumes that the data can be found in the `data` directory for this notebook. And, to make things simpler on you, I've included the same data file that I'm using here in the `data` directory in the accompanying repository---so, if you're feeling lazy, you can actually skip everything that we've just done to get the data for this particular example.\n\nOne final note on getting the data, unless you change the name when you download the file, it'll be saved as `rows.json`, but that's not a terribly descriptive name, so I changed mine to `sfpd.json`. You can use either one, but again, remember if you're not using the data file that comes with the repository, you'll either need to change the name of the downloaded file, or alter the code below for it to work.\n\n> Incidentally, if you are following along and would like to get the exact same results as I do here without using the data file in repository, you'll need use the same dates that I do. As of this recording, the past six month period would be 04/01/2015 - 10/01/2015.\n\nSo, you have the data, and now you just need to read it in.

            "source": "## Creating the Basemap Object\n\nTo create our map object, we'll need a couple of things. First, we need to specify a projection to use. A map projection, in case you forgot, is a mechanism for translating points on a spherical surface, like the earth, onto a 2-dimensional plane, like a map (for a more in-depth explanation of this concept, please take a look at the first three lessons of this section).\n\nSo far we've only seen how to specify a projection by passing in its name to the `Basemap` constructor via the [`projection`][1] parameter. There is another way, however, the [`epsg`][2] argument. The former is a string representing one of the projections supported by the basemap library (incidentally, you can print the `basemap.supported_projections` variable for the full list of supported projections). An EPSG code is used to specify a coordinate reference system, which in layman's terms is just a way to turn points on the surface of the earth into x and y coordinates for use in a map. So, for our purposes, they can be considered the same thing as a map projection, and I'll be using the term projection from here on out to represent both. \n\nThe projection we'll be using for this lesson is known as the [World Mercator][3] projection. It's used by nearly every online mapping application, and it's even referred to as the Google Projection for just that reason, and so it's a great choice for showing street level details. The EPSG code for the World Mercator projection is [(EPSG:3857)][4] and we'll pass that in with the `epsg` parameter when we create our `Basemap` instance.\n\nThe second piece of data we need is a bounding box for the portion of the map that we want to view. The Basemap constructor takes four different parameters that define this bounding box: two representing the upper right corner of the bounding box, and two more representing the lower left corner. And, just like you saw in the last lesson, you can easily get these coordinates using Google Maps to get the latitude and longitude for each corner.\n\nTo do so, simply open up a browser and navigate to [Google Maps][4]. Type 'San Francisco, CA' in the search box to center the map on San Francisco. Then, choose a point on the map that will serve as the upper right corner of the bounding box. This point will need to be far enough right so as to not cut off a portion of the city if a straight line were to be drawn through the point that was perpendicular to the bottom of the screen, and the same should be true for a line drawn through the point and perpendicular to the side of the screen. Right click on your chosen point and select \"What's here?\". A small rectangular box should pop up at the bottom of the screen containing, amongst other information, the latitude and longitude of the chosen point. This will be the lat/lon coordinates of the upper right corner of the bounding box. Now, do the same for the lower left corner and copy all of these coordinates into their corresponding parameters to create the Basemap object that we'll use throughout this lesson.\n\n\n[1]: http://matplotlib.org/basemap/users/mapsetup.html\n[2]: http://spatialreference.org\n[3]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Mercator\n[4]: http://spatialreference.org/ref/sr-org/6864/\n[5]: https://www.google.com/maps/",

In previous lessons, we drew the map ourselves using some built-in methods from the `Basemap` class, or by drawing the shapes ourselves, like we did for the county boundaries in the last lesson. In this lesson, however, we'll be using the `arcgisimage` method to retrieve a map image using the ArcGIS REST API. By default, the `arcgisimage` method pulls maps from the [ArcGIS online][1] service, but you can override that to pull images from any other service that implements the ArcGIS REST API, and we'll see an example of how to do that a little later on. \n\nBefore we grab our map though, we'll need to adjust the size of the figure, otherwise we'll end up with something too small to be of any real use. The dimensions below are the width and height of the image we're going to pull from the server in inches. They may seem a bit large, but after playing around with the size a bit, I found that anything below a width of 20 inches would result in a map that did not include the smaller streets in the city. Not to worry about the size though, the notebook will resize the image to fit the cell, so you'll be able to see everything without scrolling all over the place.\n\n[1]: http://server.arcgisonline.com/ArcGIS/rest/services",

And, in the past two lessons, we've seen examples of how we can use this tool to present useful visualizations of real world geographical data. Hopefully, this section, and the last two lessons in particular, will inspire you to grab some interesting data, and map it!",
