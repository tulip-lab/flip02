Gradient learning</span>\n\nOnce you define the loss function, you can minimize the loss by using gradient descent algorithm or its variants. The idea is that starting at a point in the parameter space, following the directions of gradients estimated at that point will increase the loss function. To reduce the loss, you should go the opposite directions. So, the basic gradient descent algorithm is to iteratively update the parameters until reaching a global (local) minima. For parameters $\\mathbf{\\theta}$ with gradients $\\frac{\\partial{J}}{\\partial{\\mathbf{\\theta}}}$, the update will take the form:\n\n$$\n\\mathbf{\\theta}=\\mathbf{\\theta}-\\eta\\frac{\\partial{J}}{\\partial{\\mathbf{\\theta}}}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\eta > 0$ is the learning rate. Learning rate $\\eta$ is an important parameter to be tuned. A low learning rate cause the model to learn slowly. High learning rate can help the model learn faster but may fail to converge as the parameters will bound around the convergence point in the parameter space.\n\n<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tuliplab/mds/master/Jupyter/image/dl/example02/high-learning-rate.png\", width=300>\n\nA simple way to select learning rate is to try different learning rates, typically between `1e-5` and `1`, and draw the graph of loss after each iterations or epochs.

Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)</span>\n\nFor gradient descent, we need to empirically estimate the average loss using all training data:\n$$\nJ(\\mathbf{\\theta})=\\frac{1}{M}\\sum_{i=1}^{M}\\mathcal{L}(\\mathbf{x}^{(i)}, y^{(i)}, \\mathbf{\\theta})\n$$\n\nwhere $\\mathcal{L}$ is the per-example loss $\\mathcal{L}(\\mathbf{x}, y, \\mathbf{\\theta})=-\\log{p(y|\\mathbf{x};\\mathbf{\\theta})}$.\nUnfortunately, estimating the average loss over a large training set is computationally expensive. Stochastic gradient descent (**SGD**) is an extension of the gradient descent algorithm. For each step of the training algorithm, we can sample a minibatch of example $\\mathbb{B}=\\{\\mathbf{x}^{(1)},\\mathbf{x}^{(2)},..,\\mathbf{x}^{(m^{\\prime})}\\}$ The minibatch size $m^{\\prime}$ is typically chosen to be a relatively small number of examples, ranging from 1 to a few hundred. The estimate of the gradient will be:\n$$\n\\mathbf{g}=\\frac{1}{m^{\\prime}}\\nabla_{\\mathbf{\\theta}}\\sum_{i=1}^{m^{\\prime}}\\mathcal{L}(\\mathbf{x}^{(i)}, y^{(i)}, \\mathbf{\\theta})\n$$\n\nThe weight update in stochastic gradient descent will be:\n\n$$\n\\mathbf{\\theta}=\\mathbf{\\theta}-\\eta\\mathbf{g}\n$$\n\nOptimization algorithms that use only a single example at a time are called stochastic methods while optimization algorithms that use more than a single examples at a time are traditionally called minibatch stochastic methods. It's now common to simply call them stochastic methods.\n\n<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tuliplab/mds/master/Jupyter/image/note.gif\" width=\"20\", align=\"left\"></img> **Some notes**:\n- Using small batch size can lead to unstable estimates. The standard error of the mean estimated from $m^{\\prime}$ samples is given by $\\sigma\\mathbin{/}\\sqrt{m^{\\prime}}$. So, Training with such a small batch size might require a small learning rate to maintain stability due to the high variance in the estimate of the gradient.\n- Large batches provide a more accurate estimate of the gradient. However, as we increase batch size from 100 to 10,000, the latter requires 100 times more computation than the former but reduces the standard error of the mean only by a factor of 10.\n- Small batches can offer regularizing effect perhaps due to the noise they add to during the learning process. Generalization error is often best for a batch size of 1. However, the total runtime can be very high due to the need to make more steps, both because of the reduced learning rate and because it takes more steps to observe the entire training set.\n- Multicore architectures are usually underutilized by extremely small batches.\n- Some kinds of hardware achieve better runtime with specific sizes of arrays. Especially when using GPUs, it is common for power of 2 batch sizes to offer better runtime. Typical power of 2 batch sizes range from 32 to 256, with 16 sometimes being attempted for large models.\n- The simplest way to do feed a minibatch to our computational graph in Tensorflow is to use placeholder nodes. They are typically used to pass the training data to TensorFlow during training.\n\n**Reference: Chapter 8 - Adaptive Computation and Machine Learning, Deep Learning Textbook**",

Momentum</span>\n\nStochastic gradient descent can sometimes be slow, especially when the gradients are of high curvature, small but consistent or noisy. Imagine the loss as the height of a canyon with steep sides. Randomly initializing the parameters is like starting at a location in the canyon and optimizing the loss is like going down the canyon. The black path in the picture below depict how SGD wastes time moving back and forth across the narrow axis of the canyon:\n\n<figure>\n  <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tuliplab/mds/master/Jupyter/image/dl/example02/momentum.PNG\" width=300>\n  <figcaption text-align=\"center\">(*The picture is adapted from Chapter 8, Deep Learning Textbook*)</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\nMomentum algorithm, proposed by Boris Polyak in 1964, accelerates learning in such situation by accumulating an exponentially decaying moving average of past gradients and continues to move in their direction. Momentum introduces a velocity vector $\\mathbf{v}$. It is the direction and the speed at which the parameters move through the hyperparameter space. The velocity is set to an exponentially decaying average of the negative gradient. We can interpret the decay as a result of friction that keeps the velocity from growing too large. The name momentum is derived from a physic analogy, in which the negative gradient is a force moving a particle through parameter space, according to Newton\u2019s laws of motion. Momentum in physics is mass times velocity. In the momentum learning algorithm, we assume unit mass, so the velocity vector $\\mathbf{v}$ may also be regarded as the momentum $\\mathbf{m}$ of the particle.\n\nAt each iteration, the local gradient (multiplied by the learning rate $\\eta$) is added to the momentum vector $\\mathbf{m}$, and you can update the weights by simply subtract this momentum vector:\n\n$$\n\\begin{align}\n\\mathbf{m} &= \\beta\\mathbf{m} + \\eta\\nabla_{\\mathbf{\\theta}}J(\\mathbf{\\theta}) \\\\\n\\mathbf{\\theta} &= \\mathbf{\\theta} - \\mathbf{m}\n\\end{align}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\beta$ is the momentum hyperparameter. The higher the hyperparameter is, the bigger the influence of past gradient is. The momentum hyperparameter is usually start at a small number, such as 0.5, and increased gradually to 0.9 or 0.99.\n\nWhen local gradient keeps pointing to a certain direction, momentum will pickup in that direction, allowing the update path to tranverse the canyon lengthwise and converge faster, as shown by the red path in the picture above.",

This is optional, but the graph will look much nicer in TensorBoard if its nodes are well organized.\n2. Next, we get the number of inputs by looking up the input matrix\u2019s shape and getting the size of the second dimension (the first dimension is for instances).\n3. The next three lines create a W variable that will hold the weights matrix. It will be a 2D tensor containing all the connection weights between each input and each neuron; hence, its shape will be `(n_inputs, n_neurons)`. It will be initialized randomly, using a [truncated normal (Gaussian) distribution](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/truncated_normal) with a standard deviation of $\\frac{2}{\\sqrt{n_{inputs}}}$. Using this specific standard deviation helps the algorithm converge much faster.\n4. The next line creates $\\mathbf{b}$ variable for biases, initialized to `0` (no symmetry issue in this case), with one bias parameter per neuron.\n5. Then we create a subgraph to compute $\\mathbf{Z} = \\mathbf{W}^{T} \\mathbf{X}  + \\mathbf{b}$. This vectorized implementation will efficiently compute the weighted sums of the inputs plus the bias term for each and every neuron in the layer, for all the instances in the batch in just one shot.\n6. Finally, if the activation parameter is set to \"relu\", the code returns *`relu(z)`* (i.e., *`max(0,z)`*), or else it just returns a linear *`z`*.",
