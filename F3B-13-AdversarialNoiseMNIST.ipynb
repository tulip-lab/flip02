    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The previous Tutorial #11 showed how to find so-called adversarial examples for a state-of-the-art neural network, which caused the network to mis-classify images even though they looked identical to the human eye. For example, an image of a parrot became mis-classified as a bookcase when adding the adversarial noise, but the image looked completely unchanged to the human eye.\n",
    "\n",
    "The adversarial noise in Tutorial #11 was found through an optimization process for each individual image. Because the noise was specialized for each image, it may not generalize and have any effect on other images.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial we will instead find adversarial noise that causes nearly all input images to become mis-classified as a desired target-class. The MNIST data-set of hand-written digits is used as an example. The adversarial noise is now clearly visible to the human eye, but the digits are still easily identified by a human, while the neural network mis-classifies nearly all the images.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial we will also try and make the neural network immune to adversarial noise.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tutorial #11 used NumPy for the adversarial optimization. In this tutorial we will show how to implement the optimization process directly in TensorFlow. This might be faster, especially when using a GPU, because it does not need to copy data to and from the GPU in each iteration.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is recommended that you first study Tutorial #11. You should also be familiar with TensorFlow in general, see e.g. Tutorials #01 and #02."

    "This example shows an input image with a hand-written 7-digit. The adversarial noise is then added to the image. Red noise-pixels are positive and make the input image darker in those pixels, while blue noise-pixels are negative and make the input lighter in those pixels.\n",
    "\n",
    "The noisy image is then fed to the neural network which results in a predicted class-number. In this case the adversarial noise fools the network into believing that the 7-digit shows a 3-digit. The noise is clearly visible to humans, but the 7-digit is still easily identified by a human.\n",
    "\n",
    "The remarkable thing here, is that a single noise-pattern causes the neural network to mis-classify almost all input images to a desired target-class.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two separate optimization procedures in this neural network. First we optimize the variables of the neural network so as to classify images in the training-set. This is the normal optimization procedure for neural networks. Once the classification accuracy is good enough, we switch to the second optimization procedure, which tries to find a single pattern of adversarial noise, that causes all input images to be mis-classified as the given target-class.\n",
    "\n",
    "The two optimization procedures are completely separate. The first procedure only modifies the variables of the neural network, while the second procedure only modifies the adversarial noise."

But it was apparently not possible to make the neural network immune to all target-classes simultaneously. Perhaps this would be possible using another method.\n",
