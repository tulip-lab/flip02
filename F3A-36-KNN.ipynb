However, for time series classification, there are less out-of-the box solutions. Many of the typical classification algorithms (Logistic Regression, Random Forests, SVM etc) are applicable to time-series data when the temporal data structure is abstracted away through feature engineering.\n\nMy experience with this approach has been poor. The full timeseries feature vector contains a large amount of valuable information that can be lost through the process of flattening the datastructure.\n\nI began researching the domain of time series classification and was intrigued by a recommended technique called K Nearest Neighbors and Dynamic Time Warping. A meta analysis completed by Mitsa (2010) suggests that when it comes to timeseries classification, 1 Nearest Neighbor (K=1) and Dynamic Timewarping is very difficult to beat [1].\n\n## K Nearest Neighbors & Dynamic Time Warping",

            "source": "K Nearest Neighbors is a classification algorithm familiar to many. It takes a unlabled observation (the star above) and compares it to a population of labled observations (blue and orange circles). By finding the K nearest circles to the star, we can infer the class label for the star through majority voting.\n\nWe can also use KNN in the context of time series data. The question becomes, \"how do we compute the distance between two timeseries sequences\"? \"Dynamic Time Warping\" is a technique that was heavily used for speech recognition in the 80s. The DTW algorithm finds the optimum alignment between two sequences of observations by warping the time dimension with certain constraints.\n\nBecause of this temporal dimension warping, DTW is good for classifying sequences that have different frequences or that are out of phase. Later we'll see how we can use DTW to classify whether a person is walking, lying down, sitting etc.\n\nThe above right diagram shows how a DTW distance matrix representation. Each cell is computed by measuring the distance between $A_i$ and $B_j$. The red path represents the shortest path and hence optimum alignment of the two sequences. \n\n$$DTW_{AB} = SUM(shortest\\ paths_{AB})$$\n\n#### Max Warping Window Allowed\nComputing the full distance matrix between A and B scales with $O(n^2)$, where n is the number of sequences in A and B. This performance can be improved by constraining the amount of warping allowed. This limits the number of cells that need to be computed in the DTW distance matrix. Research by Keogh et al has shown that a warping window not only improves performance but also improves classification accuracy [2].",

So, comparing 500 training observations to 500 test observations results in 250,000 DTW distances to be computed. And each (unconstrained) DTW distance calculation takes over 65K calculations each (256 x 256). This results in 16.3 billion calculations for just 500 x 500 observations.. Clearly not a scalable classification technique!\n\nPerformance improvements can be achieved by reducing the `max_warping_window` parameter.
