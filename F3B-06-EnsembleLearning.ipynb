    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial created an ensemble of 5 convolutional neural networks for classifying hand-written digits in the MNIST data-set. The ensemble worked by averaging the predicted class-labels of the 5 individual neural networks. This resulted in slightly improved classification accuracy on the test-set, with the ensemble having an accuracy of 99.1% compared to 98.9% for the best individual network.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, the ensemble did not always perform better than the individual neural networks, which sometimes classified images correctly while the ensemble misclassified those images. This suggests that the effect of using an ensemble of neural networks is somewhat random and may not provide a reliable way of improving the performance over a single neural network.\n",
    "\n",
    "The form of ensemble learning used here is called [bagging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bootstrap_aggregating) (or Bootstrap Aggregating), which is mainly useful for avoiding overfitting and may not be necessary for this particular neural network and data-set. So it is still possible that ensemble learning may work in other settings.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Technical Note\n",
    "\n",
    "This implementation of ensemble learning used the TensorFlow `Saver()`-object to save and reload the variables of the neural network. But this functionality was really designed for another purpose and becomes very awkward to use for ensemble learning with different types of neural networks, or if you want to load multiple neural networks at the same time. There's an add-on package for TensorFlow called [sk-flow](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/master/tensorflow/contrib/learn/python/learn) which makes this much easier, but it is still in the early stages of development as of August 2016."
