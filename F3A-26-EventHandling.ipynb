Specifically, in this lesson, we'll be looking into the built-in interactivity that matplotlib provides, and in addition, we'll also see how we can take advantage of matplotlib's event handling API to insert our own code into our chosen backend's event loop so we can achieve much of the same functionality that some of the more popular browser-based visualization libraries provide.\n\nNow, this is usually the point in the lesson where I would say something like \"let's go ahead and get started by running the standard setup code\", but in this case, that code is not so standard.\n\nIf you take a look at the code in the next cell, everything should look pretty familiar to you, with the exception of the very first line. On line 1, we're calling the `%matplotlib` magic command, as we always do to set up our notebook, however, we would normally pass in the `inline` parameter here to specify that we want to setup our notebook for displaying matplotlib figures inline. In this lesson though, we'll be using the brand new `notebook` option that was added in matplotlib version 1.4. This new option works with IPython version 3 or higher, but if you're running an earlier version, you can still get the same functionality, you'll just need to pass in the `nbagg` option instead of `notebook`.\n\nWhat the `notebook` option does is use the new `NBAgg` backend created by Phil Elson to enable interactive figures in a Jupyter notebook. Using this option we will be able to use nearly all of the interactive features that matplotlib supports all from within our Jupyter notebook. \n\nSo, let's go ahead and run the setup code below to get our notebook ready to display interactive versions of our matplotlib plots inline.",

            "source": "## Built-in Functionality\n\nThe very first thing to notice here, is that our figure looks a bit different. It now has some sort of title bar across its top, with what looks like a power button at its right edge, and along the bottom left edge, it now has a series of buttons. These buttons are where we will find the majority of the interactivity that the `NBAgg` backend provides, but let's ignore these right now, and instead just try mousing over the figure itself.\n\nNotice, that as soon as the cursor enters the figure, a pair of x and y coordinates show up at the bottom right edge of our plot. This readout updates with every movement of the mouse allowing us to see the actual values of a particular data point in our graph by simply hovering over it. \n\nNow, let's move onto those buttons and see what they can do for us. As you mouse over the buttons, you'll see a description of what each button can do to the right, where the x and y coordinates were displayed before. Let's click on the fourth button in the group, the one with the cross in it. This is the pan and zoom button. Clicking on this one will allow you to click on an area of the graph and drag it around the screen (i.e., panning) and right-click (or, two-finger-click for Mac users) and drag to zoom in and out. Play around with the panning and zooming functionality a bit to get a feel for it.\n\nThe next button in the group, the one with the empty square, is the zoom to rectangle button. This mode allows you to draw a rectangle around an area of the graph that you want to zoom in on. Go ahead and give it a try now, to see how it works.\n\nNow, that we've played around with our graph a bit, we may have left ourselves in a state that we don't want to be in. That's where the first three buttons come into play. We can use the second and third buttons to move back and forth through each view we've just created, just like you would with a web browser. And, the first button will reset the graph entirely.\n\nFinally, the last button in the group, the one with the floppy disk---a device most of you probably haven't even seen in real life---is the save button, and clicking it will allow you to download a copy of the plot to your local hard drive.\n\nAside from that, the only thing left is that power button at the top. Clicking on that will turn off all of the interactive features of the plot. I'd be careful clicking on that one though. Once you click it, there's no going back without running the code in the cell again.\n\n## Event Handling\n\nHaving the ability to pan and zoom is all well and good, but wouldn't it be great if you could respond to things like mouse clicks and key presses? Well, fortunately, you can through the extensive [events API][1] that matplotlib provides, and hooking your code into the event loop is super simple. Just call the [`mpl_connect`][2] method from the current figure's canvas object and pass in the name of an event and a callback function and you're all set up to handle that event. When the specified event occurs, your callback function will be called and it will be passed one of several [`matplotlib.backend_bases.Event`][3] objects specific to the type of event your callback function is handling.\n\n### Handling Mouse Buttons Events\n\nAs an example of the events API in action, we're going to create a figure that will allow us to plot some random data by simply clicking on a point in the graph. Let's start by creating our callback function.\n\nThe code in the next cell creates a handler function that takes a `matplotlib.backend_bases.Event` object, specifically, an instance of the `matplotlib.backend_bases.MouseEvent` class, and will use the x and y coordinates where the user clicked to plot a handful of normally distributed, random data points. One thing to notice is that we check which button was clicked before plotting the points, and we only do so if the left mouse button was clicked, i.e., button 1.\n\n[1]: http://matplotlib.org/users/event_handling.html\n[2]: http://matplotlib.org/api/backend_bases_api.html#matplotlib.backend_bases.FigureCanvasBase.mpl_connect\n[3]: http://matplotlib.org/api/backend_bases_api.html#matplotlib.backend_bases.Event",

The reason for doing this is that, with auto scaling on, the graph will go nuts rescaling itself to fit all of our data points as tightly as possible. \n\nAfter that, we'll get the canvas object from our figure and call the `mpl_connect` method to register our callback function with the button press event.\n\nNow, if we run the code below, we should get an empty plot that will allow us to add data points to it by picking a point around which our callback function will randomly place a small number of data points.",

If we click on one of the built-in interactivity buttons, like the pan and zoom, or zoom to rectangle buttons, and try to use the chosen functionality in our graph, it will work, but we'll also end up plotting some data points everywhere we click. What we really want is to ignore all clicks when anything other than normal mode is turned on. To do that, we'll need to grab a reference to the toolbar, so we can check what mode we're in. \n\nThe following code is exactly the same event handler as above, but we added a few extra lines to prevent us from plotting points when using one of the built-in modes.

Well, if you're doing everything in a Jupyter notebook, you could have a separate cell for each set of parameters, but that's a bit cumbersome and doesn't allow you to work interactively with your data. What you'd really like to do is hook up a handful of UI components, e.g., sliders, text boxes, and radio buttons, to your function and use that to tweak the plotted results.

This is fantastic, but what I really love most about the ipywidgets library, and more specifically the `interact` function, is that it's about the most \"bang for your buck\" you can get. As we've just seen, you simply call the `interact` function, pass in the function you want to interact with, and set some sensible defaults for the parameters of the underlying function, and you have an extremely useful interface---all with just one line of code. To make things even easier, we could've just used the `interact` function as a decorator on the `plot_fv` function instead of making a separate call to it later. \n\nOf course, the interface we created is not without problems. For example, it doesn't make much sense to invest a negative amount of money, and the interest rate selector doesn't give us much granularity at all. And, probably the most egregious behavior of the interface is the fact that you can choose 0 for the number of times the investment compounds per year---this just ends up throwing a division by zero error if you try it.\n\nFortunately, the `interact` function allows us to change the behavior of each individual UI element just by changing the information that we pass into it, and in the next lesson, we'll see just how to do that.

While it's awesome that we can create a full interace with just one line of code, it wasn't, as you might have guessed, the most refined interface. However, in this lesson, we'll take a look at the tools the ipywidgets library gives us to create a much more polished UI for our plotting functions.\n\nSo, let's dive right in, and get the setup out of the way.\n\nThe use case we were working with was one in which we've received a large lump sum of money, and we want to pick out the right investment vehicle for our recent riches. To do that, we created two functions: the first calculates the future value of an investment, and the second plots the future value of an investment over several years. Both of these functions have been reproduced in the next cell, so let's go ahead and run it so we can continue from where we left off in our last lesson.",

Specifically, we were left with two main issues. First, the limits of each parameter were poorly defined, e.g., we could choose negative values for each parameter, and in the case of the number of compounding periods, we could even end up with a division by zero error. Second, the granularity of some of the parameters was not quite what we wanted, specifically, we could only choose three different interest rates, and one of those was negative!\n\nFortunately, the `interact` function we used to create our interface allows us to fix these issues by passing in a tuple for each keyword argument where we can specify the minimum and maximum values of each slider, and optionally, a step value as well. \n\nIn the next cell, we modify the previous call to `interact` to add some sensible limits, and refine the granularity of our interface a bit.",

First, it would be great if the interface defaulted to the 10-year T-Bond info that we've been using all along. Second, those one character labels for each of the parameters, they probably aren't the easiest to understand, so it would be nice if they were a bit more verbose. Finally, we don't really need the plot to update as we're selecting a new value, it'd probably be a bit nicer if it only updated one time after we had chosen a new value for a parameter, so we'll need a way to stop the continuous updates as well.\n\nTo make all of these changes, we'll need to create our own widget objects instead of relying on the `interact` function to create them for us. Doing so is quite easy, just call the constructor for each widget and pass in the options you want as keyword arguments. \n\nIn the next cell, we will set the min, max, step, and default values for each slider. We'll also give each one an easier to understand and more verbose label. Finally, we'll set the `continuous_update` parameter to `False` for each widget to make sure the plot only updates once we've selected a value. ",

But, wouldn't it be nice if we could plot multiple curves on a single plot so we could compare each of the outcomes to find just the right investment? To do so, we just need to hold onto a figure object so we can update it rather than creating a new figure every time the `plot_fv` function is called.\n\nIn the next cell, we'll create a global `fig` variable that will hold a `Figure` object that we create with the `pyplot.figure` function. Then we'll redefine our `plot_fv` function to use the new `fig` object in place of the current figure when plotting new lines. This will result in the current plot being updated with new lines every time the `plot_fv` function is called, which will allow us to compare different sets of variables and their outcome. \n\nAside from that, the only other difference can be seen on line 17 where we're adding a simple legend to the plot to make it a bit easier to make comparisons between each set of options.",

Now, there are times would you probably want the same widgets in different interfaces to be tied together, but in the current case, this isn't what we want, so instead we'll be creating brand new widgets for each parameter.\n\nThis time, we'll also do things a little differently as well. Notice in the code below, that we're only creating three widgets, we've purposely left off the years widget. The reason for the neglect of the years variable is that, now that we are plotting each line on the same plot, adjusting the number of years will lead to changes in the scale of the plot, which isn't fair for comparison, and frankly a little jarring as well. To account for the fact that the number of years is now fixed, we must use the `ipywidgets.fixed` function when calling `interact`, or as you've no doubt noticed, the `interactive` function. So, the big question then, as I already alluded to, is what is the difference between `interact` and `interactive`, and why are we now using the latter? \n\nWell, the main difference between the two is that the `interactive` function returns a container object that wraps all of the widgets and provides a way for us to get the current values of each. We'll see a use for this container object in the next cell, but for now let's just go ahead and run the code to create our new interface.",

The first two actions are easy, simply call the `Figure.clf` function to clear the figure, and use the `clear_output` function provided by IPython's `display` module to clear the contents of the current cell. For the last bit though, we'll need to get the current set of values from our interface. Since we used the `ipywidgets.interactive` function in our last cell to create our interface, we have a container object that provides us with a simple interface for getting those values. You can see where we're getting the values using the `kwargs` variable and passing them into our `plot_fv` function on line 12 of our custom `clf` function below.\n\nThe last bit to notice is that we add our new `button` object to the container object returned by the call to `ipywidgets.interactive` in the previous cell.

The result would've been nearly identical, but one nice feature of adding the button to the container is that it fits into the interface a bit better. Adding the button to the container object will result in its dimensions being adjusted to fit the interface as well as the padding between it and the rest of the interface objects.

By default, `ipywidgets` right aligns all labels and left aligns all widgets, so we should have a nicely aligned interface, but unfortunately, we've chosen labels that are longer than the hard minimum that `ipywidgets` uses. Luckily, the interface is just a set of HTML elements like anything else in a web page, so we can simply adjust each element's visual attributes using CSS like we would an interface in a normal web page. \n\nIn the next cell, we use the `html` cell magic to add a bit of CSS to our page.
