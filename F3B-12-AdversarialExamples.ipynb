    "In the previous tutorials, we have used various kinds of Deep Neural Networks for classifying images with varying success. In this tutorial we will see a simple method for finding so-called Adversarial Examples that cause a state-of-the-art neural network to mis-classify any input image to whatever class we choose. This is done simply by adding a small amount of 'specialized' noise to the input image. The changes are imperceptible to humans, but it fools the neural network.\n",
    "\n",
    "This builds on the previous tutorials. You should be familiar with neural networks in general (e.g. Tutorial #01 and #02), and knowledge of the Inception model is also helpful (Tutorial #07)."

    "\n",
    "We have also added a new loss or cost-function to the graph, that calculates the so-called cross-entropy, which is a measure of how well the Inception model has performed at classifying the noisy image.\n",

    "Because the Inception model is constructed from many basic mathematical operations that have been combined, TensorFlow allows us to easily find the gradient of the loss-function using the chain-rule of differentiation.\n",

    "\n",
    "We have shown how to find so-called Adversarial Examples that cause the Inception model to mis-classify images. Through a simple optimization process, we find noise that can be added to an input image so as to cause the Inception model to mis-classify the image, even though each pixel has only been changed slightly and the difference is imperceptible to humans.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, the noise can be optimized so as to give a score (aka. probability or confidence) of nearly 100%. So not only is the input image mis-classified, but the neural network is apparently very confident that it has correctly classified the image.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a general problem for neural networks and it is a very serious problem! Until we have a good understanding of why this happens and how to fix it, we cannot trust neural networks in critical applications. Imagine what would happen if a self-driving car ignores a stop-sign or a person crossing the road because its neural networks have mis-classified the input images.\n",

    "* Try another formula for calculating the step-size in `find_adversary_noise()`. Can you make the optimization converge faster?\n",
    "* Try blurring the noisy input-image right before it is input into the neural network. Does it remove the adversarial noise and cause correct classification again?\n",
    "* Try lowering the bit-depth of the noisy input image instead of blurring it. Does it remove the adversarial noise and result in correct classification? For example if you only allow 16 or 32 colour-levels for Red, Green and Blue, whereas normally there are 255 levels.\n",
    "* Do you think your noise-removal also works for hand-written digits in the MNIST data-set, or for strange geometric shapes? These are sometimes called 'fooling images', do an internet search.\n",
    "* Can you find adversarial noise that would work for all images, so you don't have to find adversarial noise specifically for each image? How would you do this?\n",
    "* Can you implement the optimization in `find_adversary_noise()` directly in TensorFlow instead of using NumPy? You would need to make the noise a variable in the TensorFlow graph as well, so it can be optimized by TensorFlow.\n",
    "* Explain to a friend what Adversarial Examples are and how the program finds them."
